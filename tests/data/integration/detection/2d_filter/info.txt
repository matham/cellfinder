# Test data info (for internal use)

The signal images in this folder were derived from the images in the test
structure_split_test/signal directory. They were generated by passing them
through the 2d filters (median, gaussian, laplacian) using values of
`soma_diameter=16, log_sigma_size=0.2, n_sds_above_mean_thresh=10`.

The tiles directory contains the output from `TileProcessor.get_tile_mask`, indicating
for each tile whether the tile is in the brain or not.
